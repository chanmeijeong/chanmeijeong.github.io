# What is RIPS?
## Definition
RIPS is the most popular static code analysis tool to automatically detect vulnerabilities in PHP applications. By tokenizing and parsing all source code files, RIPS is able to transform PHP source code into a program model and to detect sensitive sinks (potentially vulnerable functions) that can be tainted by userinput (influenced by a malicious user) during the program flow. Besides the structured output of found vulnerabilities, RIPS offers an integrated code audit framework.
